Many new products and platforms have been created to help sales organizations with these changes but sales reps and sales managers lack a compelling, easy to use, interface to organize, visualize, and share data about their prospects and sales performance.</p><p>Solution:  We are building a Relationship Intelligence platform that automatically interfaces and integrates with all backend sales systems and tools (CRM, Email, Calendar, Social, etc).  Our initial product radically simplifies how sales reps organize and interact with the prospect/buyers  It&#x2019;s an elegantly-designed product adapted to let them efficiently sell to their prospects without the headaches of CRM entry or spreadsheets.</p><p>We&#x2019;re an Atlanta startup looking for passionate hackers that love building hard products.

While this future has become clear to many, its essential implication remains elusive: that in an all-container world, the old abstraction of the virtual machine becomes prohibitively confining -- a suffocating skeuomorph that incarcerates infrastructure in the past. At Joyent, we believe in containers to our marrow -- and that the transition to native container infrastructure presents opportunities to fundamentally rethink computing, networking and storage systems. We are looking for more people like us: systems generalists who love to cut code -- software engineers who are afraid of neither the biggest of problems nor the grittiest details, who are comfortable in every stage of the software design and implementation process, and who find gratification in seeing their work available as open source. We&apos;re seeking engineers who are able to move up and down the stack: at any given time, we may find ourselves debugging a nasty device firmware bug, rewriting a portion of the operating system kernel, instrumenting the networking stack, debugging a virtual machine or interpreter, or developing code for a distributed system to allow containers to be understood or managed -- perhaps all in the same day or as part of the same problem. We expect that you have detailed knowledge of a favorite language, tool or system, but that you are also able to quickly pick up new ones as needed. And while implementation experience is essential, enthusiasm and interest can trump experience; we are willing to take a chance on someone who wants to step up.</p><p>We have immediate job opportunities in both downtown San Francisco and Vancouver (both close to mass transit) -- and we are remote-friendly in the US and Canada for those who have a track record of contributing to our open source communities (or who otherwise have a proven ability to work remotely).

This also means that, when there are issues, you need to inform the right people, explain what&#x2019;s going wrong, and help get things resolved and moving forward again. Speaking of process, we have a design team who handle HTML and CSS, a product and UX team who produce clear specifications, a QA team to help us build things well, and a two-week sprint cycle for getting things done.

Our server-side code is written in C# and our web front end has some Javascript, so you&#x2019;ll need to know these or be able to pick them up.

Allow us to introduce ourselves. We are Expensify and we do &quot;expense reports that don&apos;t suck!&quot; (Google &quot;expensify&quot; to read more.) We&apos;re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren&apos;s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:</p><p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it&apos;s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all &#x2014; we do the sucky work so our customers won&apos;t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.</p><p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn&apos;t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We&apos;ve done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia, Portugal and the Philippines. We are going to Cambodia AT THE END OF THIS MONTH...want to join us?</p><p>- Super talented, in a general way. We&apos;re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing/designing/building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job &#x2014; you&apos;re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.</p><p>- Specifically talented in a programming way (or if not, shoot as an email anyways!). You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL &#x2014; not because you know them all, but because you&apos;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you&apos;re this sort of person, you&apos;ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn&apos;t for you.</p><p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That&apos;s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it&apos;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I&apos;m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don&apos;t accidentally overlook you?</p><p>There are probably many ways to do that.
